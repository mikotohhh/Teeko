# Game of Teeko 

How to play Teeko

It is a game between two players on a 5x5 board. Each player has four markers of either red or black. Beginning with black, they take turns placing markers (the "drop phase") until all markers are on the board, with the goal of getting four in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or in a 2x2 box as shown above.
If after the drop phase neither player has won, they continue taking turns moving one marker at a time— to an adjacent space only!—until one player wins.

MiniMax algorithm
Minimax algorithm is decesion making rule used in AI. The algorithm analyzes worst case senario and minimizing the loss. In this program which is two player zero-sum game, AI player assumes each player plays optimally everytime and check next few possible game states to make a best decision.
You can find more about the algorithm here. Minimax algorithm
